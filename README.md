Battle of the Student!

The app is a locationbased version of the board game Risk. The players move along the campus to predetermined locations, where a minigame (based on the faculty) will start and the student will play the game to get votes, which in the end will determine who will win and become the student president, of the fictive universe.

A group project created in the classes Pervasive Computer and Interactive Media @ Aarhus University.
